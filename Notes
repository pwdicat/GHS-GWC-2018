These are notes on the story line and stuff that we want to have happen on the website. This has no effect whatsoever on the website, I THINK. 

Marietta's Story
  -She is a common unicorn who is creative and kind, and is a good unicorn and friendy to all. She lives in Shimmer Meadow, in a village near
  the Castle.
  

Jim's Story
  -The royal prince of all the land
  

Ash's Story
  -They are that stereotypical and necessary character that's emo and angsty and with a tragic past. Born on an island volcano
  (like nightwings) which exploded, leaving Ash with a large scar on their face. When they finally wash up on a new island, everyone
  shuns Ash because of the scar. Ash covers the scar in a sheet which leads the other unicorns to believe that Ash is evil, especially 
  with their dark fur. Ash then takes refuge in the dark forest, where their story begins.
